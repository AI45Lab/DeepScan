# Optional model metadata used by `tools/summarize_exp_to_csv.py`.
#
# Keys can be:
# - a model `run_name` (recommended; e.g. "qwen2.5-7b")
# - or a human `model_name` (e.g. "Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct")
# - or anything else you want, as long as it matches one of the lookup keys
#   printed by the script when metadata is missing.
#
# All fields are optional; missing fields will be left blank in the CSV.
#
# Example:
# qwen2.5-7b:
#   release_month_year: "Sep 2024"
#   organization: "Alibaba"
#   country: "🇨🇳"
#   open_source_status: "yes"        # yes/no (also accepts true/false, open/closed)
#   reasoning_capability: "yes"      # yes/no
#
# Fill in (or extend) entries below as needed.
